# ArtificialVision
A brief presentation about a Aritificial Vision project I made using ROS 2 and OpenCV library in C++

The aim of the project was to make different configurations in the camera of the Thiago Robot to do the following tasks:
1. Detection of balls of a particular color, their center and contour, both in the 2D Image and 3D space.
2. Detection of a human being in the scene.
3. Projection of the ball detected in the image (2D) to 3D, taking in count the depth, center and radius of the ball.
4. Projection of distance lines from 3 meters to 8 meters from the robot camera.

You can see a little demonstration of the project in the following [video](https://youtu.be/JfL-zgRR6mQ)
